# gulpfile-compiling-js-less-starter-pack

##For better workflow!
###JS:
- compile ES6
- modules support(browserify)
- minify JavaScript
###LESS:
- concat
- compile to CSS
- minify CSS

###How to:
1. Write "npm install" after downloading repository in console
2. Write "gulp" in console 

After that gulp will be watching your JS files from src/js/*.js and LESS files from src/less/*.less and compiling that files into dist directory.
