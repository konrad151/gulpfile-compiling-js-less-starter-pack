## For better workflow!
### JS:
- concat
- compile ES6 (babelify)
- modules support (browserify)
- minify JavaScript
### LESS:
- concat
- compile to CSS
- minify CSS

### How to:
1. Write "npm install" after downloading repository in console
2. Write "gulp" in console 

After that gulp will be watching your JS files from src/js/*.js and LESS files from src/less/*.less and compiling that files into dist directory.
